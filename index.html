        <h3>Halloween</h3>

            <h3>Halloween Parties</h3>
            <p>By the 1920s and 1930s, Halloween had become a secular but community-centered holiday,
                with parades and town-wide Halloween parties as the featured entertainment.</p>

            <p>Between 1920 and 1950, the centuries-old practice of trick-or-treating was also revived. Trick-or-treating was a relatively inexpensive way for an entire community to share the Halloween celebration. 
                In theory, families could also prevent tricks being played on them by providing the neighborhood children with small treats.</p>

            <h3>Halloween Movies</h3>
            <p>A direct sequel to the original "Halloween" was released in 2018, starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle.
                 A sequel to that—"Halloween Kills," the twelfth film in the "Halloween" franchise overall—was released in 2021.</p>
            <p>Considered a classic horror film down to its spooky soundtrack, "Halloween" inspired other iconic “slasher films” like “Scream,” “Nightmare on Elm Street” and “Friday the 13.” 
                More family-friendly Halloween movies include “Hocus Pocus,” “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” “Beetlejuice” and “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.” </p>
